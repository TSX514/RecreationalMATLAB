# Recreational MATLAB

## What's this?
This repo contains various small coding projects using MATLAB to process audio in rather weird ways. This primarily serves as an outlet for me to learn MATLAB, as I find that the best way to learn a programming language is to make projects with it. 

## Can I use these in my project?
Sure, go nuts. Make sure you add a reference to this github reprository. 

## How do I make something interesting with this?
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Honestly, not sure. The best way to experiment with these functions is to run a peice of audio through it, add an effect, and then process the audio through the function again to reverse it. 

## Why?
Why not?
