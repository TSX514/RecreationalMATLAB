% This function takes an audio signal of your chosing and reverses the low %
% and high frequency content. There's no other way of putting this other   %
% than the fact that anything you put through here probably won't sound    %
% good. That said, I'd reccomend inputting a sample, flipping it, applying %
% an effect to the sample and then flipping it back. If you use something  %
% like distortion or reverb that introduces new sounds/harmonics and then  %
% flip them, you can get some really interesting results.                  %
%                                                                          %
% There's a few demo files in the AudioExamples folder. Check 'em out!     %
%                                                                          %
% At somepoint, if I can work out how to make this work using a circular   %
% buffer and do this in real-time, I'll make a .vst3/.au. For now have     %                                                           %                                                    
% fun with this.                                                           %
